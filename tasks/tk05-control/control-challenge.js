/**
 * TASK :
 * 1. Build the logic inside the comparePopulation() function given below, so that the function compares two countries from the given countries object. The function must either return :
 * - {The name of first country} population is bigger than {the name of second country}
 * - {The name of first country} population is smaller than {the name of second country}
 * - {The name of first country} has the same population as {the name of second country}
 * 2. Use the function three times comparing :
 * - Switzerland vs. France
 * - France vs. Italy
 * - Italy vs. Italy
